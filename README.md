# CMake-Cpp-Library-Example

## Description

This is a simple example of a C++ library that can be built with CMake.

All the examples are made to be compiled with CMake for Windows, Linux and macOS, except for some like PThreads that are
only available on Linux.

Each directory contains a CMakeLists.txt file that is used to build the library, the complete explanation are in the
README.md file of each directory.
